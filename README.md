# Sparse PCA: model comparison

This GitHub repository contains all Matlab codes, R codes, and functions that support the "A guide for sparse PCA: a model comparison" manuscript. The repository includes DataGeneration, Simulation, and Application files.

## Simulation: 
GP and pathSPCA functions require additional functions that are freely available. GP required GPower.m function needed. This function is available on the author website: http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~journee/ . pathSPCA requires maxeig.m and FullPathCov.m functions needed. These functions are available on the author website: https://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/index.html .

## Application:
The data for the Dimension reduction application can be downloaded freely at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE7329, under the name "Series Matrix File(s)." For preprocessing steps, please refer to the manuscript
